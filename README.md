Features:
- all imports are shown as nodes
- nodes with more than k=5 imports are highlighted in red. Files with the most imports are typically our entrypoint files, or where the core logic lies. I used this heuristic to figure out which files are the most important - useful for an onboardee to know where they should start.

Take look at the screenshot file to see the final result!
